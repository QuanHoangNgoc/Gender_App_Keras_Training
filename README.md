### about 
- This is a self-learning project. 
- I learn about [keras guides] and use the [ipynb pipeline] to train a gender model with keras 2.0-tf on Colab Cloud GPU. 
- I found a way to interact with the model through  an [interaction GUI app] on Local Devices  and use c# to deploy it with winform .NET. 
- But, to deploy the model that has fast response speed, I need a server process run anytime. I use [flask] to implement the server api for c# client.

# Repo Branch 
- main: Contain some files, folders about guide and pipeline for all about process and project. 
- project_banch: All about Gender App. 
- dataset_branch: Dataset for training process.  

# Pipeline 
### training: 
- keras 2.0-tensorflow
- Colab cloud (GPU), ipynb
- dataset folder for training: ~160K face images  
### deployment server: 
- flask
- Local, python
### interaction app: 
- winform .NET app
- Local, c#
