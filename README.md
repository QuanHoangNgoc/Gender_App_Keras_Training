### 📚 About

Embark on a journey of self-learning with me as I explore the realms of machine learning and deployment techniques:

- **Learning Journey**: Delve into [Keras guides] 📘 and utilize [Jupyter Notebook pipeline] 📊 to train a gender classification model with Keras 2.0-tf on Colab Cloud GPU.
- **GUI Application Development**: Craft an interactive GUI app on local devices using C# WinForms to interact seamlessly with the trained model 💻.
- **Server Deployment**: Implement a Flask server API to ensure rapid response times for the deployed model, enhancing communication with the C# client 🚀.
