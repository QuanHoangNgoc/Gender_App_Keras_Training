### about 
- This is a self-learning project. 
- I learn about [keras guides] and use the [ipynb pipeline] to train a gender model with keras 2.0-tf on Colab Cloud GPU. 
- I found a way to interact with the model through  an [interaction GUI app] on Local Devices  and use c# to deploy it with winform .NET. 
- But, to deploy the model that has fast response speed, I need a server process run anytime. I use [flask] to implement the server api for c# client.
