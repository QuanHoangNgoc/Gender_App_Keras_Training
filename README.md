# 🌟 Self-Learning Journey: Machine Learning and Deployment

## 📚 About

Welcome to my self-learning journey in **Machine Learning** and **Deployment Techniques**, undertaken during Tet 2024. This project is a comprehensive exploration of training a machine learning model, developing a GUI application, and deploying the trained model operation as a server.

---

## 🔍 What is it?

This project covers the complete pipeline from training a machine learning model to deploying it and creating an interactive application. The key components include:

- **Model Training**: Training a gender classification model using **Keras 2.0 with TensorFlow** on **Google Colab** with GPU support.
- **GUI Application**: Developing a **C# WinForms** application that interacts with the trained model to classify gender based on input images.
- **Server Deployment**: Setting up a **Flask API** server to host the model, enabling the GUI app to interact with it efficiently.

## 🤔 Why did we do it?

The goal of this project is to enhance my skills in machine learning, model deployment, and application development. By building this project, I aim to gain a practical understanding of the end-to-end process of creating and deploying machine learning models, which is essential for real-world applications.

## 👥 Who is it for?

This project is designed for:

- **Students and Learners**: Anyone interested in understanding how to train a machine learning model and deploy it in a practical application.
- **Developers and Engineers**: Professionals looking to explore the integration of machine learning models with GUI applications.
- **Educators and Enthusiasts**: Those who want to teach or learn about deploying machine learning models in a real-world context.

### 🖥️ Demos and Results:

- **Interactive WinForms App**: A C# application that allows users to classify gender using the trained model.
- **Flask API**: A locally hosted server that processes requests from the GUI app and returns classification results.

## 🔧 How did we do it?

### 🧠 Model Training:

- **Framework**: Keras 2.0 with TensorFlow backend.
- **Platform**: Google Colab with GPU support for efficient training.
- **Dataset**: Approximately 160,000 face images were used for training the gender classification model.

### 🌐 Deployment:

- **Server**: Flask API server developed in Python to host the trained model.
- **Interaction**: The server processes requests from the C# WinForms app, classifying images and returning results.

### 🖥️ GUI Application:

- **Framework**: WinForms using .NET in C#.
- **Functionality**: The app allows users to upload images and receive gender classification results by interacting with the Flask server.
